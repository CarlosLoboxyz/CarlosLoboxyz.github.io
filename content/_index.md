# About Me

Hi there, my name is Carlos. I'm a programmer who likes writing and learning new things, this blog is an attempt to improve my skills as a web developer and also share with you some of the things i like about this wonderful tech world.

Here you can find some useful tools & guides about things related to the UNIX/Linux environment and also some others not necessarily related to the programming ecosystem (Math, Chess, Music, etc...)

Hope you like it and thanks for passing by ðŸ˜”ðŸ‘Œ.
